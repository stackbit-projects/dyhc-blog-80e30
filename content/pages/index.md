      [**DO YOU HAVE CLOUT**](https://bitclout.com/u/doyouhaveclout) is a
      volunteer project under [bitcloutpulse](https://bitcloutpulse.com), the
      Bloomberg for [BitClout](https://bitclout.com), which collects all the
      best profiles on BitClout and features them daily across BitClout,
      [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/bitclout), and this site. It is like
      a mix of Shark Tank and America's Got Talent.
