excerpt: >-
  I started doing filmmaking and photography professionally 2 years ago now. At
  first it wasn’t full time as I was also studying in university, but at the
  beginning of last year I took the leap and now I’m a full time content
  creator. I work with different brands (Land Rover, Zhiyun Tech) and tourism
  boards (Visit Faroe Islands ; Atlantic Airways) and I create content for them
  in order to bring awareness for destinations or introduce new products on the
  market.

### Questions & Answers

<br>

#### When did you join BitClout?

> 3-4 days ago

<br>

#### How long have you been doing this?

> 10 years + 

<br>

#### Do you have a following outside of BitClout?

> 72.7K follower on Twitter ([@gokhanyucel](https://twitter.com/gokhanyucel))

<br>

#### How will you be working on expanding your reach here?

> I believe that good curation will always attract people. Since my account is one of the first (decent) ones, the reaching will be done by high quality art selection. And when reclout  feature comes the effect will multiply.

<br>

#### What plans do you have for your content and profile?

> I want this account to become "the curator" for the new age of social media. Especially with the dawn of NFTs, what we perceive as art will change drastically, I'd love the drive that change. It was damning to see "gif"s as merely fun toys while they were an art form all along.

<br>

#### How will you be providing value to your holders in the long term?

> Even though I use this account for curation, I'm actually a creative director in real life (For example, this is one of my projects with 350K following: [YouTube AnatolianRockRevivalProject](https://www.youtube.com/c/AnatolianRockRevivalProject/featured)). I come up with new ideas & projects all the time. So, i don't think that this will be different for BitClout. I'll grasp and use the mechanics of this medium to turn it into a beautiful place. I believe that it will also have a positive impact on my account.

<br>

#### Are you willing to hold your coin a long time or do you have plans to sell in some structured way to benefit from the influx of capital?

> I'm in it for the long run. I believe this will be the future of social media.
