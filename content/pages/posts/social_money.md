### Questions & Answers

**When did you join BitClout, and why?**

> I joined 3-4 days ago because simply put I live for the creator economy. Adopting new social protocols early on can provide once in a decade opportunities.

<br>

*   **Q: How long have you been in this “area”?**

*   A: I bought my first bitcoin in 2014, but I used it for transactional purposes and it wasn’t until 2016 did I become more active when I founded the financial algorithm programming club @ my university. In 2017 I realized there was a 35% spread in usd/krw priced bitcoin so I took out the rest of my student loans and starting flying between Korea and US with bags full of money doing what I coined as “airbnbatrage”. I had found out Korean citizens were allowed $50k of annual remittance, so I would stay with an airbnb super host, send them bitcoin, and we’d go to the bank together and withdraw it in KRW. I would fly back with suitcases full of yuan that I would convert back into USD, then back into BTC and repeat the process. After several trips I scaled it to 5 more countries, legitimized the process by using stat arb, and eventually sold the company to a prominent Chicago based cryptocurrency prop shop.

*   A: I've 85k on YouTube but it's not a pictures channel.

*   **Q: How will you be working on expanding your reach here? What plans do you have for your content and profile?**

*   A: I post high quality content with good captions, following/liking people who could be interested in my work. Culture is value.

*   **Q: Are you willing to hold your coin a long time or do you have plans to sell in some structured way to benefit from the influx of capital?**

*   A: I'm holding my coin with my main account (naruto) and i want to hold that long term, maybe sell a little bit if $BitClout price will rise
