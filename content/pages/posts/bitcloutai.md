### Questions & Answers

<br>

#### When did you join BitClout?

> 11 days ago.
>
> Because BitClout seems like the first decentralized social network that's hit product-market fit and I believe experience is the only form of understanding. I want to start building now, such that newcomers will come, follow, and invest into @bitcloutAI if/as the platform grows.

<br>

#### How long have you been doing in your field or area?

> Been in tech since 2012.
>
> Nanotechnology on the R\&D side (forward osmosis, graphene),
> Battery engineering on the Tesla Model 3 Battery Module (M3BM) team under @elonmusk
> Artifical intelligence (Deep learning), doing both research, development, and deployment

<br>

#### Do you have a following outside of BitClout?

> Nah, I got ~4000 but very high quality network on LinkedIn

<br>

#### How will you be working on expanding your reach here?

> Engagement in Global and Local community, daily.

<br>

#### What plans do you have for your content and profile?

> Take what we do for a living, and document into BitClout. Then use it as the seedbed for producing more channels of content on top of them.
>
> Right now, we post hot topic AI stuff (1) :
>
> Then recreate it (2) ourselves in the lab to provide people familiarity with high abstract concepts.
>
> And create new channels of content like -Sending Our Future VCs This- (3)
>
> Currently evaluating the value of newsletter (4)

#### How will you be providing value to your holders in the long term?

> Providing consistent entertaining & informative content
> Staying within and circle of competence and leverage:
>
> 1\. First to market: 1st legitimate artificial intelligence creators doing hands-on AI work
> 2\. High content throughput: Documenting our real-life work as a content
> 3\. Attract attention via simplifying, grew 30% within 24 hours
> 4\. High barrier to entry
>
> Think about it.
>
> When @elonmusk, and all the builders within tech come into BitClout, it would be hard for them to not invest in @bitcloutAI.

<br>

#### Are you willing to hold your coin a long time or do you have plans to sell in some structured way to benefit from the influx of capital?

> Bitcoin generally takes on a 4-year market cycle, and we are currently entering (or have already) the phase of the market cycle characterized by the highest volatility to the upside. I believe the huge influx of money into NFTs and BitClout is simply a confirmation to the above statement. A rising tide lifts all boats.

> Hence, I will be selling so I can buy more at a significant discount by doing :
>
> (1) Sell 50% when I speculate the start of next global correction would be, which is Dec 2021 / Jan 2022
>
> (2) Wait until capitulation of Bitcoin and all related instruments (15-18 months)
>
> (3) Buy back my coin, and others, 10 cents on the dollar

<br>

#### What are your areas of expertise and experience?

> Bleeding edge technology (e.g. AI, Crypto, and Sustainable Energy)
>
> Energy - Tesla Engineer, Model 3 Battery Module Production Engineering team
> Crypto - Flipping since 2017
> AI - Artifical intelligence scientist  & graduate researcher

<br>

#### Is there anything you need beyond investment to accomplish what you want?

> Engagement with high quality, high functioning creators that have different domain expertise, such that we can figure out how to meld two different domains together
