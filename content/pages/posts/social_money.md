##### Social_Money is building software bridging between the digital/crypto world and the real world. Sharing a long history in the crypto space and financial arbitrage, Social_Money has great insight into what makes crypto tick.

### Questions & Answers

**When did you join BitClout, and why?**

> I joined 3-4 days ago because simply put I live for the creator economy. Adopting new social protocols early on can provide once in a decade opportunities.

<br>

**How long have you been in this “area”?**

> I bought my first bitcoin in 2014, but I used it for transactional purposes and it wasn’t until 2016 did I become more active when I founded the financial algorithm programming club @ my university. In 2017 I realized there was a 35% spread in usd/krw priced bitcoin so I took out the rest of my student loans and starting flying between Korea and US with bags full of money doing what I coined as “airbnbatrage”. I had found out Korean citizens were allowed $50k of annual remittance, so I would stay with an airbnb super host, send them bitcoin, and we’d go to the bank together and withdraw it in KRW. I would fly back with suitcases full of yuan that I would convert back into USD, then back into BTC and repeat the process. After several trips I scaled it to 5 more countries, legitimized the process by using stat arb, and eventually sold the company to a prominent Chicago based cryptocurrency prop shop.

> 2017 I was brought in by lobbyists to help Congress draft bills regarding the adoption and regulation of blockchain. I worked particularly close with the House Financial Services Committee and the ranking chairman. On top of that I drafted one of the first NAL’s for the SEC based around something I was building at the time called CloutToken. The concept was that you could buy a creator’s token to get access to exclusive content and benefits.

> In 2020 I launched app.matter.online and scaled it to 150k+ users, while helping 50k musicians earn $1m+ during covid from digital subscriptions and products.
>
> In 2021 I built a low-code mvp for [@getkuudos](https://twitter.com/getkuudos) and onboarded a 1m follower influencer. The focus is to build and dominate what I call mid funnel fabric, turning existing communities into multi-platform ecosystems. Within 2 weeks we won a competition with Mr.Beast for $25,000, amassed 10k users on our waitlist, piqued VC interest, and have onboarded our first customers paying $130 a month for the software.

<br>

**Do you have a following outside of BitClout?**

> It’s not huge but I do. I prefer to keep this pseudo-anonymous for now until Bitclout has gotten closer to product market fit.
>
> Personally I have millions of streams as a singer/songwriter on spotify. Yesterday I posted my first Tik Tok and got hundreds of thousands of views before Tik Tok suspended me for promoting a “scam”.
>
> On top of that I was recently funded by soundcloud to build a GenZ musician focused influencer house. The 6 creators I manage get 30m monthly impressions.

**How will you be working on expanding your reach here?**

> So far I’ve been able to grow without using real life networks by being an active thought leader. Eventually I will bring in my existing communities (like my discord with a couple thousand members).

<br>

**What plans do you have for your content and profile?**

> Right now one big thing I’m considering is turning the @social_money page into the hub for my businesses. This means instead of charging subscriptions, holders of my coin will get access to software that I am building on top of the Bitclout L1.

**How will you be providing value to your holders in the long term?**

> Access to software.
> Potentially doing a smart contract ISA with my existing revenue streams.
> Active contributor to the protocol and thought leader.

**Are you willing to hold your coin a long time or do you have plans to sell in some structured way to benefit from the influx of capital?**

> If you can tell from the % of my own coin I own, I’ve been buying more of my own coin everyday because I’m here for the long game. As I’m building my company on top of bitclout, I will need liquidity to onboard a VP of engineering  (considering
