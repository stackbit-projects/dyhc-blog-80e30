### Questions & Answers

<br>

#### When did you join BitClout, and why?

> I joined a week ago, as I saw friends of mine from the creative industry posting stories about it on IG. At first I wasn’t interested, but then I started learning more about it and ended up creating an account.

<br>

#### How long have you been doing this?

> I started doing filmmaking and photography professionally 2 years ago now. At first it wasn’t full time as I was also studying in university, but at the beginning of last year I took the leap and now I’m a full time content creator. I work with different brands (Land Rover, Zhiyun Tech) and tourism boards (Visit Faroe Islands ; Atlantic Airways) and I create content for them in order to bring awareness for destinations or introduce new products on the market.

<br>

#### Do you have a following outside of BitClout?

> Yes - I mainly use Instagram. I have almost 4K followers there. [@lostinayaland](https://instagram.com/lostinayaland)

<br>

#### How will you be working on expanding your reach here?

> I still haven’t announced it anywhere, that I‘m on BitClout as I wanted to see what I can achieve naturally within the app. And so far so good. I reached 100 followers in a couple of days and people are interested in investing.
>
> I soon plan to announce it on social media and start discussions about the topic with my followers.

<br>

#### What plans do you have for your content and profile?

> I post 3-5 times a day currently and I‘m still trying out different things content wise. I want to get a better understanding of the community, before I focus on one certain thing.
>
> I definitely will start adding more and more detail with time and eventually I want to discuss current projects I‘m working on with my followers and investors, so that they know what they’re putting their time and money in.



<br>

#### How will you be providing value to your holders in the long term?

> I have this idea of making them a part of my projects. For example currently I‘m working on passion project (video) about women in the filmmaking industry. I want to get those people involved, tell them more about it, show them bts footage and if I get some really big investors I will add their names to the film credits.
>
> I just want for everyone to feel included in what I do and with time as the platform expands, I will definitely come up with more ideas to do that.

<br>

#### Are you willing to hold your coin a long time or do you have plans to sell in some structured way to benefit from the influx of capital?

> For now I’m definitely holding, the platform is at it‘s absolute start and I want t see where that’s going. In the future (at least 6 months) from now of the coin is growing so much as now and there are ways to make that part of my income, I will come up with a structured way of doing that, which I will of course share with my investors.
>
> I want to invest this “profit” in expanding my creative portfolio - working on more passion projects, providing more gear for my team, traveling to places where stories need to be told about conservation for example. This would definitely help me a lot in achieving that.
